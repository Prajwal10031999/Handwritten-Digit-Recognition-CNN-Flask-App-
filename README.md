The MNIST dataset is an acronym that stands for the Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology dataset.

It is a dataset of 60,000 small square 28×28 pixel grayscale images of handwritten single digits between 0 and 9.

The task is to classify a given image of a handwritten digit into one of 10 classes representing integer values from 0 to 9, inclusively.

It is a widely used and deeply understood dataset and, for the most part, is “solved.” Top-performing models are deep learning convolutional neural networks that achieve a classification accuracy of above 99%, with an error rate between 0.4 %and 0.2% on the hold out test dataset. <br />
<br />

The handwritten digit recognition is the capability of computer
applications to recognize the human handwritten digits. It is a
hard task for the machine because handwritten digits are not
perfect and can be made with many different shapes and sizes.
The handwritten digit recognition system is a way to tackle this
problem which uses the image of a digit and recognizes the
digit present in the image.
